Tagging as 5.4.6


--------------------

subversion:
	- increment version number to 5.4.6
	- oops.
	- tandanu via svn r10835: test commit to see if the curse issue is fixed
	- nbluewiz via svn r10834: # Gain count voice volume (Kolt and Mosh).
	- ultrashining via svn r10833: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r10832: incrim
	- Omega via svn r10831: Can't wait forever, so doing an improper tag so users don't have to use broken out of date mods while they wait.
	- nbluewiz via svn r10830: # Fix flash bar is not working.
	- nbluewiz via svn r10829: # Fix move bar not starts as enlarged. # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r10828: oops, sometimes I forget how frame works
	- Omega via svn r10827: Add smart clump check range finder to garrosh

	- nbluewiz via svn r10821: # Fix bar flashing bug. # Fix non-working show timer recovery message. # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r10820: make all things match
	- Omega via svn r10819: Some warning improvements for more clarifications. Some spells always have moveaway or moveto rules so more specific warnings useful. Maybe now people with debuff on ordos will be less likely to stand in group and annoy everyone. NOTE: Moveaway ~= Run away. Run away is running away from/kiting an attack. Move away is just telling you to look at your dang range finder and make sure no one is near you. Also, made the sha shear warning smarter on fallen protectors. Now it won't tell the inferno strike target to run out of group if they get targeted by sha shear. :)
