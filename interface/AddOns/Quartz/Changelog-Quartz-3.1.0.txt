Tag as 3.1.0


--------------------

Hendrik Leppkes:
	- Update toc for 5.0
	- Fix width of the latency bar
	- Fix position of the Spark
	- Improve bar positioning with a moved/resized UIParent
	- Add an option to hide the Default UI Focus Cast Bar
	- Properly restore the Player CastBars events in MoP
	- The total bar width now includes the icon, and does not change when the icon is shown/hidden.
	- Added a new option to center spell name or time on the center of the bars backdrop (castbar + icon) instead of just the castbar.
	- Adjust default icon gap to better fit the new backdrop
	- Expand the Bars backdrop around the spell icon
	- Name the mirror bar frames
	- Mirror: Don't use OnHide to disable the OnUpdate.
	Its certainly possible that something else is hiding this frame (or the parent), like opening the default blizzard map.
	- Update list of channeld spells and their ticks
	- Fix display of channeling tic indicators on the player cast bar
	- Cleanup Reset Spells in "Swing" module. All "next-swing" attacks have been removed since 4.0
